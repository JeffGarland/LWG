<p>Relational operators for containers should sfinae; if the underlying type is not comparable, neither should the container be. Same applies to <tt>tuple</tt> and <tt>pair</tt>.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Make the relational operators of containers and utility components reflect the validity of the underlying 
element types.</p>
