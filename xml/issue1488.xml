<p>
Cooperate with WG14 to improve interoperability between
the <tt>C++0x</tt> and <tt>C1x</tt> threads APIs. In particular, <tt>C1x</tt>
mutexes should be conveniently usable with a <tt>C++0x</tt>
<tt>lock_guard</tt>. Performance overheads for this combination
should be considered.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<blockquote><p>
Remove <tt>C++0x</tt> <tt>timed_mutex</tt> and
<tt>timed_recursive_mutex</tt> if that facilitates
development of more compatible APIs.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The concurrency sub-group reviewed the options, and decided that closer harmony should wait until both standards are published.

SG1 recommends: Close as NAD
<p/>
Papers about C compatibility are welcome, but there may be more pressing issues. C threads are not consistently available 
at this point, so there seems to be little demand to fix this particular problem.
