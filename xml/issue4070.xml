<sref ref="[fs.path.fmtr.funcs]"/> says:

<blockquote>
If `charT` is `char`, `path::value_type` is `wchar_t`,
and the literal encoding is UTF-8, then the escaped path is
transcoded from the native encoding for wide character strings to UTF-8
with maximal subparts of ill-formed subsequences substituted with
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">u+fffd</span>
replacement character per the Unicode Standard [...].
Otherwise, transcoding is implementation-defined.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This seems to mean that the Unicode substitutions are only done
for an escaped path, i.e. when the `?` option is used. Otherwise, the form
of transcoding is completely implementation-defined.
However, this makes no sense.
An escaped string will have no ill-formed subsequences, because they will
already have been replaced as per <sref ref="[format.string.escaped]"/>:
<blockquote>
Otherwise (<em>X</em> is a sequence of ill-formed code units),
each code unit <em>U</em> is appended to <em>E</em> in order as
the sequence <code>\x{<em>hex-digit-sequence</em>}</code>,
where <code><em>hex-digit-sequence</em></code> is the shortest hexadecimal
representation of <em>U</em> using lower-case hexadecimal digits.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
So only unescaped strings can have ill-formed sequences by the time
we do transcoding to `char`, but whether or not any
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">u+fffd</span> substitution
occurs is just implementation-defined.
</p>

<p>
I believe we want to specify the substitutions are done when transcoding
an <em>unescaped</em> path (and it doesn't matter whether we specify it
for escaped paths, because it's a no-op if escaping happens first,
as is apparently intended).
</p>

<p>
It does matter whether we escape first or perform substitutions first.
If we escape first then every code unit in an ill-formed sequence is
individually escaped as `\x{hex-digit-sequence}`.
So an ill-formed sequence of two `wchar_t` values will be escaped as
two `\x{...}` strings, which are then transcoded to UTF-8.
If we transcode (with substitutions first) then the entire
ill-formed sequence is replaced with a single replacement character,
which will then be escaped as `\x{fffd}`.
SG16 should be asked to confirm that escaping first is intended,
so that an escaped string shows the original invalid code units.
For a non-escaped string, we want the ill-formed sequence to be
formatted as &#xfffd;, which the proposed resolution tries to ensure.

<note>2025-06-11; SG16 comments and improves wording</note>
<p>
The "and not converting from `wchar_t` to UTF-8" wording added in the index of implementation-defined 
behavior by the current proposed resolution should be changed to "and the literal encoding is not UTF-8".
<p/>
It was noted that "the literal encoding" is ambiguous in both the normative wording in 
<sref ref="[fs.path.fmtr.funcs]"/> p5 and in the new wording quoted above. In both cases, the intent 
is to refer to the "ordinary literal encoding". However, some SG16 participants were reluctant to include 
a drive-by fix with the proposed resolution for this issue since the ambiguous literal encoding reference i
s a pre-existing and separable issue. Those same SG16 participants were more concerned that the same 
wording was used in both <sref ref="[fs.path.fmtr.funcs]"/> p5 and in the corresponding entry of the 
implementation-defined behavior index. I would defer to the LWG chair to decide whether to address this 
as an additional related clarification with this change or as a separate editorial or LWG issue.
<p/>
The minimal change is to replace "and not converting from `wchar_t` to UTF-8" with "and the literal encoding 
is not UTF-8". The optional change is to insert "ordinary" before "literal encoding" as well. Once that is done, 
I'll have SG16 confirm they are content with the new proposed resolution.

<p>
SG16 unanimously approved new wording produced during the discussion.
The group concluded that the intended behavior would be best specified by
introducing additional names to denote the sequence of transformations
that produce the intended effect. Status updated SG16 &rarr; Open.
