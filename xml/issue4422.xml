<p>
The `meta::access_context` type is expected to contain some `meta::info`
objects, which would make it a consteval-only type. But we don't actually
specify any members, so nothing in the current specification says you can't
persist one until runtime.

<blockquote>
<p>-1-
The access_context class is a non-aggregate<ins>, consteval-only</ins> type
that represents a namespace, class, or function from which queries pertaining
to access rules may be performed, as well as the designating class
(<sref ref="[class.access.base]"/>), if any.
