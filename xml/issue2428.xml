<sref ref="[using.headers]"/>/3 says
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A translation unit shall include a header only outside of any external declaration or definition [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This wording appears to be borrowed from the C standard. However, the term "external declaration" is not defined 
in the C++ standard, and in fact is only used here as far as I can tell, so it is unclear what it means. The C 
standard does define external declarations as (WG14 N1570 6.9 External definitions/4-5):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
As discussed in 5.1.1.1, the unit of program text after preprocessing is a translation unit, which consists of a 
sequence of external declarations. These are described as "external" because they appear outside any function 
(and hence have file scope). [...] An external definition is an external declaration that is also a definition of 
a function (other than an inline definition) or an object.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The corresponding description of a translation unit in C++ is "A translation unit consists of a sequence of declarations." 
(<sref ref="[basic.link]"/>/3).
<p/>
So it appears that the C++ counterpart of "external declaration" in C is simply a "declaration" at file scope. There 
is no need to specifically limit the statement in <sref ref="[using.headers]"/>/3 to file-scope declarations, however, 
since every non-file-scope declaration is necessarily inside a file-scope declaration, so banning including a header 
inside file-scope declarations necessarily bans including one inside non-file-scope declarations as well.

<p>
This wording is relative to N3936.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Edit <sref ref="[using.headers]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A translation unit shall include a header only outside of any <del>external</del> declaration or definition, and shall
include the header lexically before the first reference in that translation unit to any of the entities declared
in that header. No diagnostic is required.
