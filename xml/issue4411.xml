<p>
During the review of LWG <iref ref="4286"/> it was noticed that the
proposed resolution did not include a change to `__cpp_lib_ranges_indices`,
which was added in Sofia by <paper num="P3060R3"/>
(which was after the issue was opened).

It also doesn't change `__cpp_lib_constexpr_utility`, and probably should do.

It doesn't change `__cpp_lib_tuple_like`,
but that's less clear whether it should do.
The relevant changes in
<code>&lt;tuple&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;pair&gt;</code>
are obviously available in a freestanding implementation,
but the changes in
<code>&lt;map&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;unordered_map&gt;</code>
are not.
