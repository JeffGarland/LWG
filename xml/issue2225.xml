<title>Unrealistic header inclusion checks required</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[using.headers]"/>/3 says:
<p/>
A translation unit shall include a header only outside of any external declaration or definition, and shall 
include the header lexically before the first reference in that translation unit to any of the entities 
declared in that header.
<p/>
Per <sref ref="[intro.compliance]"/>/1, programs which violate this rule are ill-formed, and a conforming 
implementation is required to produce a diagnostic. This does not seem to match reality. Presumably, this 
paragraph is missing a "no diagnostic is required".
