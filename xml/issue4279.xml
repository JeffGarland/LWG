[fs.op.absolute] has a note giving strong encouragement, which should be normative:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
[Note <i>3</i>: Implementations are strongly encouraged to not query secondary storage, and not consider 
`!exists(p)` an error. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The part about `!exists(p)` not being an error could definitely be a <i>Recommended practice</i> paragraph.  
Referring to "secondary storage" might need to be phrased differently to be normative (maybe with a note 
clarifying that the normative wording is referring to "secondary storage").

<p>
Set priority to 4 after reflector poll.
</p>
<p>
Could the `!exists(p)` part be implementation-defined?
