<title>Size type mismatch in constraints involving <i>Cpp17Allocator</i></title>

<p>
It seems assumed that a `size_t` value can be passed to an allocator's `allocate` member 
function per the <tt><i>simple-allocator</i></tt> exposition-only concept in 
<sref ref="[allocator.requirements.general]"/> and the minimal constraints for 
allocator types in <sref ref="[container.reqmts]"/>.
<p/>
However, it is not exactly required that a type meeting the <i>Cpp17Allocator</i> requirements 
can be used with `size_t` values, because only <tt>allocator_traits&lt;A&gt;::size_type</tt>, 
which is possibly not `size_t`, is required to be usable with the allocator.
<p/>
Do we want to change these constraints, or change the <i>Cpp17Allocator</i> requirements to 
require accepting `size_t` values?

"The wording technically allows you to write
<code>allocate(same_as&lt;size_type&gt; auto)</code>
and reject any other type."
</p>
<p>
"I imagine lots of code relies on `std::size_t` being accepted.
That's surely a general design issue that's much broader than just the
<em>Cpp17Allocator</em> requirement,
and making the requirement stricter seems evolutionary."
