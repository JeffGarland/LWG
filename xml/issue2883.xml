<p>
The standard library should provide <tt>string_view</tt> parameters instead or in addition for functions defined with 
<tt>char const *</tt> or <tt>string const &amp;</tt> as parameter types. Most notably in cases where both such 
overloads exist or where an internal copy is expected anyway.
</p>
<p>
It might be doubted that the non-null termination of <tt>string_view</tt> could be an issue with functions that pass 
the <tt>char *</tt> down to OS functions, such as <tt>fstream_buf::open()</tt> etc. and those shouldn't provide it 
and favour generating a <tt>std::string</tt> temporary instead in that case. However, <tt>std::path</tt> demonstrates 
it is usable to have <tt>string_view</tt> overloads and there might be many places where it can be handy, or even better.
</p>

<p>Proposed change: Provide the overloads for <tt>std::regex</tt>, the exception classes, <tt>std::bitset</tt>, 
<tt>std::locale</tt> and more.</p>
