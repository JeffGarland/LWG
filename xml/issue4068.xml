<p>
During <paper num="P2300"/> review the suggestion was raised that it might
be helpful to be able to talk about "an object that models `Concept`"
instead of "an object whose type models `Concept`" or other more verbose forms.

"OK with finding a way to shorten this, but not as suggested above.
Overloading the term "models Concept" for both objects and types would be
confusing."

or 'a `stoppable_token` object'"
